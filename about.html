  <h1>This is me.</h1>

  <h2>Marine Life Aficianado</h2>
  <p>I studied Marine & Freshwater Biology at university, I scuba dive when I can (certified to PADI Rescue Diver, but don't hold me to that if you're in trouble on the water!) and I will passionately advocate for sharks at any given opportunity.</p>

<h2>Book Worm</h2>
<p>I read voraciously - I read 90 books in 2017, although I haven't topped that since!  I read mostly fiction, but have been known to delve into true crime, autobiographies and books about fonts and the origin of words and idioms.</p>

<h2>Life-long Learning Champion </h2>
<p>I want to learn on a regular basis, whether that be welding, archery, knitting, baking, or coding.  I have done all of these on my own or through a course.  Learning more is a top priority for me and I will continue to hone my skills or add new ones throughout my life</p>
