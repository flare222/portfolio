      <p class="about-me">I studied Marine & Freshwater Biology at university, I scuba dive when I can (certified to PADI   Rescue Diver, but don't hold me to that if you're in trouble on the water!) and I will passionately advocate for  sharks at any given opportunity.</p>

      <p class="about-me">I read voraciously - I read 90 books in 2017, although I haven't topped that since!  I read   mostly  fiction, but have been known to delve into true crime, autobiographies and books about fonts and the origin of words and idioms.</p>

      <h2 class="about-headings">Life-long Learning Champion</h2>
      <p class="about-me">I want to learn on a regular basis, whether that be welding, archery, knitting, baking, or    coding.  I have acquired these skills on my own, or through a course.  Learning more is a top priority for me and I am excited to add new skills or hone old ones!</p>
